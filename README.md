This is the final project for the HackYourFuture curriculum we did as a class using the MERN stack by following the agile methodology with our team and a group of mentors. A quick guide to what we built:

# Delivery Application ( Just like the others, but better...)

Clients can effortlessly make delivery requests from one address to another, while drivers stationed at the pick-up address can swiftly accept these requests and ensure timely delivery of packages to their final destinations. Say goodbye to delivery hassles and embrace a streamlined solution with our user-friendly platform.
